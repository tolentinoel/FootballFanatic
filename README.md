## Welcome to the FootballFanatic!
This CLI app was built in purpose of searching for the upcoming football events in your city. As we went along and explore the API we used for this project, this CLI app can now display events or games that can be found through city name, date, team/performer name, or stadium name. Whether it being a basketball, football, or a concert event, this program will help you keep up with date with the latest game or event schedules of you favorite team or performer.
